This version of REEgion Select is a [FieldFrame](http://brandon-kelly.com/apps/fieldframe/) fieldtype that will display dropdown <select> lists of various types of geographical regions as a custom field in ExpressionEngine.

(If you'd like to display these same dropdown <select> lists on the public-facing side of your ExpressionEngine-powered site, [please see my plugin of the same name](http://github.com/amphibian/pi.reegion_select.ee_addon/).)

The REEgion Select fieldtype will display dropdown <select> lists of:

- countries (based on the ISO 3166-1 list of countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest)
- U.S. states (based on the USPS official list of US states and possessions)
- Canadian provinces and territories
- UK counties
- Canadian provinces and U.S. states together

For each instance of the REEgion Select fieldtype you can choose which one of the aforementioned regions you'd like to display, as well as whether to use the ISO 3166-2 abbreviation as the output value for countries, states, and provinces, or to instead display the region's name.

REEgion Select is FF Matrix-compatible.
